Tmux -> Simpletest
-------------------
in it's infancy as I start out with vimscript

The goal with this is to create a vim plugin that runs a PHP test suite without having to switch tmux panes or windows or just interrupt workflow in general. Since we'll be using Simpletest in a class I'll be taking I elected to start with that.

Installed with `pathogen <https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen>`_ and also relies on `t.slime <https://github.com/tfinnell/tslime.vim>`_.
